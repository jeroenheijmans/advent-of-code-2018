# Advent of Code 2018

Solutions to the [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018) edition by Jeroen Heijmans.

## Running

Pick your poison:

- Command line: `dotnet test`
- IDE, just run all the tests with your favorite test runner

## Lessons

Here's what I learned (or noticed) each day.

1. You should _prepare_ if you want to _compete_ in challenges.
2. C#'s LINQ features are _not_ "like riding a bike".
3. Don't use all input you get for problems.
4. I have a healthy fear of DateTime types, and avoid them unless needed.
5. Using mostly "for each" in app development, I almost forgot "Off By One" errors existed.
6. Sets are *fast* for 'Contains(...)` operations.
7. **God I wish I knew Python** and its graph libraries...
8. Static typing can slow you down a lot in AoC.
9. Doubly linked lists are the bomb!
10. Not everything is (nor should be) easily unit-testable
11. **Having a partner that understands (and puts up with) your hobbies is _golden_!**
12. Advent of Code is the Game of Life for one month a year.
13. Object Oriented programming sometimes still shines.
14. Choose the right data structure for the right job.
15. **I have determination!** (And also **spent 17+ hours over two days** on this puzzle.)
16. Bulky, precise work requires concentration.
17. Physics are fun!
18. Excel to the rescue (for a quick & dirty answer). Again.
19. I _despise_ low level programming and debugging.
20. Real regex engines must be mindbending to build. 
21. I ***abhor*** low level programming and debugging.
22. Pathfinding in puzzles is tricky. Pathfinding in real games must be grueling.
23. I didn't know what "[SMT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_modulo_theories)" was, and am apparently quite bad at handcrafting one.
24. Flavor and context to problems mean a _lot_ to me!
25. Being precise is hard. Being precise at 05:00 in the morning is harder.
