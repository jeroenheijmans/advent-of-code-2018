## Compendium Repositories

I've created [a Google Chrome Extension to spice up your private leaderboard page with graphs](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ipbomkmbokofodhhjpipflmdplipblbe).
It is [open source](https://github.com/jeroenheijmans/advent-of-code-charts) if you want to contribute!

In addition, you can also check [my Advent of Code 2017 solutions](https://github.com/jeroenheijmans/advent-of-code-2017), done in JavaScript.
