# Advent of Code 2018

Solutions to the [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018) edition by Jeroen Heijmans.

## Running

Pick your poison:

- Command line: `dotnet test`
- IDE, just run all the tests with your favorite test runner

## Lessons

Here's what I learned (or noticed) each day.

1. You should _prepare_ if you want to _compete_ in challenges.
2. C#'s LINQ features are _not_ "like riding a bike".
3. Don't use all input you get for problems.
4. I have a healthy fear of DateTime types, and avoid them unless needed.
5. Using mostly "for each" in app development, I almost forgot "Off By One" errors existed.
6. Sets are *fast* for 'Contains(...)` operations.
7. God I wish I knew Python and its graph libraries...
8. Static typing can slow you down a lot in AoC.
9. Doubly linked lists are the bomb!
10. Not everything is (nor should be) easily unit-testable

## Compendium Repositories

I've created a browser extension for [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ipbomkmbokofodhhjpipflmdplipblbe) and [Mozilla Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/advent-of-code-charts/).
It is [open source](https://github.com/jeroenheijmans/advent-of-code-charts)  to spice up your private leaderboard page with graphs if you want to contribute!

In addition, you can also check [my Advent of Code 2017 solutions](https://github.com/jeroenheijmans/advent-of-code-2017), done in JavaScript.
